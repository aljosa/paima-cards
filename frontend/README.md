## Webpack Configurations

To make it easier for managing environment based webpack configurations, we using separated `development` and `production` configuration files, they are available in :

```bash
# Development webpack config
tools/webpack/webpack.config.dev.js

# Production webpack config
tools/webpack/webpack.config.prod.js
```

For further information, you can visit [Webpack Configuration](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/)

## Middleware
Middleware is automatically loaded by webpack, you just need to pack it again if you make changes.

## Compile typechain
There is a `src/typechain` folder which contains useful helpers for working with ethers library. It's comipled from ABIs in `src\abis`.
```bash
npx typechain --target=ethers-v5 'src/abis/*.json' --out-dir src/typechain
```
