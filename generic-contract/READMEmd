### Deploying generic payment contract

This folder contains some resources that can help deploy this contract.

The `GenericPayment.sol` can be directly copied into `contracts/nft/src`, and it will be built
during deployment.

The `13_deploy_generic_payment.js` belongs into `contracts/nft/migrations`, but the `13` may be taken by another contract later.
In that case it should be renamed and also replaced in `deploy.sh` on the line
```   
  npx truffle migrate --f 13 --to 13 --network $TARGET_NETWORK
```
The `deploy.sh` needs to be run from the `contracts/nft`, but it's best not to replace the existing script,
because this one is likely to get outdated. The reporting script does not exist for this deployments so
you'll have to find the address in `contract-addresses.json`, and the rest on an explorer.
